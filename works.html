      <p>Jose Rizal is most known for his literary works that inspired Filipinos to fight for independence. His two most famous novels are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Noli Me Tangere (1887):</strong> Exposed the social ills, abuses, and corruption under Spanish colonial rule.</li>
        <li><strong>El Filibusterismo (1891):</strong> A darker, more revolutionary sequel that encouraged reform and resistance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Aside from novels, Rizal wrote numerous essays, poems, and articles such as "Letter to the Young Women of Malolos," "Mi Último Adiós," and essays published in La Solidaridad. His writings awakened Filipino nationalism and became a catalyst for change.</p>
