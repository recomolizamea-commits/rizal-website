      <p>Jose Rizal was arrested and accused of rebellion due to his alleged involvement with the Katipunan, despite his advocacy for peaceful reforms. He was tried and sentenced to death by firing squad.</p>
      <p>On December 30, 1896, Rizal was executed at Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park, Manila). Before his death, he secretly wrote his final poem, "Mi Último Adiós," which expressed his love for the Philippines and hope for its freedom.</p>
      <p>His martyrdom transformed him into a national hero, inspiring Filipinos to continue the struggle for independence.</p>
