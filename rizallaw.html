      <p>The Rizal Law, or Republic Act No. 1425, was passed in 1956. Authored by Senator Claro M. Recto and sponsored by Senator Jose P. Laurel, the law requires the life, works, and writings of Jose Rizal, particularly <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>, to be taught in all schools, colleges, and universities in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>The law aimed to instill patriotism, inspire nationalism, and ensure that the youth understood the sacrifices made by Rizal and other heroes in the fight for freedom. Despite opposition from the Catholic Church, the law was enacted as a way of honoring Rizalâ€™s legacy.</p>
      <p>Today, the Rizal Law remains one of the most important educational mandates in the Philippines, reminding Filipinos of their history and national identity.</p>
